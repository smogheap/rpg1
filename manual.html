	  <h1><a name="obj"></a>Objective</h1>
	  To win RPG1, you must find your way to the
	  throne and obtain the crown.  You will likely
	  need help from many other characters.
	  <br><br>
	  You choose who you are at the beginning,
	  but you can play many roles
	  throughout the game.
	  <br><br>
	  RPG1 is a different adventure every time
	  you play.  Each new
	  game is a new world, and the world
	  will seem different depending on who you are.
	</div>
	<div>

	  <h1><a name="you"></a>Your Personal Menu</h1>

	  menu, you can select "CONTINUE" to pick up

	  time.  Darkened areas indicate places you
	  have traveled to, green spots represent
	  special-purpose areas, and the blinking dot
	  is your current position.
